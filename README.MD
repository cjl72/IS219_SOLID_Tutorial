## OOPS Principles
Object Oriented Programming, OOP, uses classes and objects to structure the program.
A class is used to create the objects, a constructor.  Classes also contain methods
which can be called on the object created by the class.  The best way to think about this is
as the class as a blueprint, a design, for an object.  Inside these blueprints it can create
objects and also tell the object what to do if called.
### 1. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is reached when an object is in a private state.  This prevents outside access into the
state of the object.  This protects it from change and such.  This can be exemplified by the 
Calculator.js class where the methods are inside the class Calculator.
```class Calculator {
static Calculations = []
    static Sum(a,b) {
        let calculation = new Calculation(a,b,Sum);
        Calculator.Calculations.push(calculation);
        return calculation.GetResults();
```
### 2. Abstraction
Abstraction is a relatively easy OOP concept.  An object should only have one high-level mechanism
for using it.  An example of this is clicking a button to turn on the tv.  This button object turns on
the tv, but is very high level and simple.  When we simplify our code it is easy to see the inheritance
hierarchy which we will see in inheritance next.  The following code shows how one file for one function
does one thing.  simplifying the coding for the object itself.
```
function Sum (a,b) {
    return a + b;
}
module.exports = Sum;
```
### 3. Inheritance
The issue that inheritance tackles is that objects can be very similar but clearly different.
How inheritance fixes that is by creating child classes that have parent classes.  One example of this
is professors at the university.  They are all a professor object, but not all professors are the same.
Through this objects can inherit the aspects of their parent object but also build upon it with their
own specific aspects.  The following is the example in the code on how inheritance is used in the calculator.
Here the StatisticsCalculator that will be made will inherit the Calculator object for basic functions.
```
class StatisticsCalculator extends Calculator{
}
```
### 4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the fourth principle which means "many shapes" in Greek.  Polymorphism is something that 
happens in the background.  The language is smart enough to tell when a parent and children objects
appear together, and sees they are different, the same method name, but different function.
The simplest possible example for this is with calculating the area of three shapes, they are all 
shapes but all different calculations.

## SOLID JavaScript Principles
### 1. S - Single Responsibility Principle
### 2. O - Open-Closed Principle
### 3. L - Liskov Substitution Principle
### 4. I - Interface Segregation Principle
### 5. D - Dependency Inversion Principle
